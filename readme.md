Preview as background and download a wallpaper fit to your current screen's resolution. Note that in many cases it will be a better solution to download the original pattern and use a _tile_ setting to fill the screen. In some cases, like Windows 10 lock screen, _tile_ is not supported and this site simplifies that process.
